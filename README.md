This was a group project on the CodeClan bootcamp course, produced over a week with a team of three.  


Movie Match is an app where users can search through a database of movies using their favourite directors and actors and find out what movies they have worked on. 
They can also search by title and add to their list of favourite movies.

Currently the app only has a limited database.

To run the application:

Inside both server and client folders, in the terminal enter "npm i"

Inside your terminal, make sure you are in the Server folder and enter "npm run seeds"

Then in the server folder enter "npm run server:dev"

Meanwhile in the client folder enter "npm start"



Enjoy!
